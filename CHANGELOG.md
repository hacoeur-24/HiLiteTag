## [1.1.3] - 2025-06-18

### Added
- Support for overlapping and nested tags
  - New `overlapTag` prop to enable overlapping highlights
  - Proper serialization and restoration of nested tag structures
  - Smart handling of overlapping tag boundaries

### Improved
- Tag restoration
  - More reliable restoration of overlapping tags

  - Better handling of marker-start and marker-end classes

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where overlapping tags were merged during serialization
- Fixed marker ID preservation during tag restoration
- Fixed nested tag structure handling in getAllTags and restoreTags

### No Breaking Changes
All new features are opt-in and backward compatible.

### To use the new features:

1. For overlapping tags:
```tsx
<HiLiteContent
  overlapTag={true}  // Enable overlapping tags
  // ... other props
>
```

2. For built-in marker selection:
```tsx
const [selectedMarkerId, setSelectedMarkerId] = useState<string | null>(null);

<HiLiteContent
  selectedMarkerId={selectedMarkerId}
  onMarkerSelect={setSelectedMarkerId}
  // ... other props
>
```

### Example
Creating nested highlights:
```tsx
// First highlight "important"
ref.current?.hiliteTag(tag);

// Then highlight "important tests"
ref.current?.hiliteTag(tag);

// getAllTags() will now properly return both markers:
[
  {
    "markerId": "inner",
    "tagId": "2",
    "text": "important",
    "beginIndex": 20,
    "endIndex": 29
  },
  {
    "markerId": "outer",
    "tagId": "2",
    "text": "important tests",
    "beginIndex": 20,
    "endIndex": 35
  }
]
```

## [1.1.2] - 2025-06-11

A small maintenance release focusing on overlap rendering and whitespace handling.

### üõ† Fixes & Improvements

- **Overlap CSS**  
  Refined nested/adjacent marker rules so highlights render seamlessly without visual gaps.

- **Whitespace Trimming**  
  Automatically trims leading/trailing spaces when wrapping across HTML nodes, preventing stray gaps or collapsed text.

- **General Fixes**  
  - Resolved a handful of edge-case tagging behaviors  
  - Improved stability when overlapping existing highlights  
  - Minor performance optimizations

## [1.1.1] - 2025-06-10

### Release Notes (June 2025)

#### üöÄ New Feature: `restoreTags`
- Added a new `restoreTags(tags: HighlightedTag[])` method to the HiLiteContent ref API.
- This allows you to restore all highlights from a JSON array (as returned by `getAllTags`), making it easy to persist and reload highlights from your database or files.
- The `HighlightedTag` type is now exported for type safety and better developer experience.

#### üè∑Ô∏è Tag & Marker Model Improvements
- **Tags** are now clearly separated from **markers** in the documentation and API. Tags are your business logic (with a unique `id`), while markers are the HTML elements used to visually represent highlights in the DOM.
- The `getAllTags()` method now returns a single entry per tag, with absolute `beginIndex` and `endIndex` values, making it robust even for repeated or nested text.
- Markers spanning multiple nodes are grouped under a single `markerId`, and the API makes it easy to select or remove the entire highlight.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Fixes & Improvements
- Improved type safety by exporting the `HighlightedTag` type and using it throughout the API and documentation.
- Updated the README with clear examples, best practices, and customization tips (including how to use `marker-start` and `marker-end` for custom borders).
- Fixed issues with restoring highlights, handling multi-node selections, and ensuring correct marker boundaries.
- Enhanced developer experience with better documentation and more robust serialization/deserialization logic.

  - Supports custom tag colors, styles, and selection color.
  - Handles whitespace and word boundaries for precise tagging.

- **Tag Management:**
  - Define tags with unique IDs, names, colors, and custom styles.

- **Selection and Removal:**
  - Select individual highlights (markers) and remove them by marker ID.
  - Selected marker color is handled automatically by the component.

- **Serialization:**
  - Extract all highlights for storage or sync with `getAllTags()`.
  - Each highlight includes marker ID, tag ID, text, and segment info.

- **TypeScript Support:**
  - Full type definitions for all public APIs.

- **Easy Integration:**
  - Simple API: `import { HiLiteContent, HiLiteTags, type TagDefinition } from "hilitetag";`
  - Works with React and Next.js projects.

#### üö¶ Usage Example

```tsx
import { useRef, useState } from "react";
import { HiLiteContent, HiLiteTags, type TagDefinition } from "hilitetag";

const tagDefs: TagDefinition[] = [
  { id: "1", name: "tag1", color: "rgba(255,255,0,0.4)", selectedColor: "rgba(255,255,0,0.8)", style: { fontWeight: "bold" } },
  { id: "2", name: "tag2", color: "rgba(255,100,100,0.4)", selectedColor: "rgba(255,100,100,0.8)", style: { fontStyle: "italic" } }
];
const tags = new HiLiteTags(tagDefs);

function App() {
  const ref = useRef<any>(null);
  const [selectedMarkerId, setSelectedMarkerId] = useState<string | null>(null);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => ref.current?.highlightTag(tags.getByName("tag1"))}>Highlight as tag1</button>
      <button onClick={() => ref.current?.highlightTag(tags.getByName("tag2"))}>Highlight as tag2</button>
      <button onClick={() => ref.current?.removeTag(selectedMarkerId)} disabled={!selectedMarkerId}>Remove Selected Tag</button>
      <button onClick={() => {
        const tags = ref.current?.getAllTags();
        if (tags) alert(JSON.stringify(tags, null, 2));
      }}>Get All Tags</button>
      <HiLiteContent
        ref={ref}
        tags={tags}
        autoWordBoundaries
        autoTag
        defaultTag={tags.getByName("tag1")}
        selectedMarkerId={selectedMarkerId}
      >
        <div onClick={e => {
          const target = e.target as HTMLElement;
          if (target.classList.contains("marker")) {
            setSelectedMarkerId(target.getAttribute("data-marker-id"));
          } else {
            setSelectedMarkerId(null);
          }
        }}>
          <h1>Welcome</h1>
          <p>Thank you for using <b>HiLiteTag</b>.</p>
        </div>
      </HiLiteContent>
    </div>
  );
}
```
